# Purpose of the Game
The Friend Finder is a dating application where users can take a ten question survey about themselves and then be appropriately matched with a mate based on their answers. The app displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. The application is run using a Node.js and Express server on the back end and the CSS Bootstrap framework on the front end.
