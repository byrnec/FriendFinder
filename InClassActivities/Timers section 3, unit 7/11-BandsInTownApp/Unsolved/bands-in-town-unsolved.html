 * Using the starter code provided to you, complete the application such that your code will search the Bands In Town API for the artist specified in the search box.

* Bands in Town is a service for finding out when and where bands and artists are scheduled to tour.

* Information on how to use query the Bands In Town API can be found [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Bandsintown/PublicAPI/3.0.0)

* Note: This is a free public API and you will not need to sign up for anything.

* **HINT:** Scroll down the API docs and study the examples. See if you can figure out how to query for an artist's information. You will need to use the `/artists/{artistname} endpoint`.

* **HINT:** The `app_id` parameter described in the docs is required, but can be set to anything you wish.
