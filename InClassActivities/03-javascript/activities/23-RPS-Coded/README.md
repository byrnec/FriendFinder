* Do as much as you can on your own, but don't be afraid to ask for help if you feel your team is struggling.

* **NOTE:** A `for-loop` is not technically necessary to make our RPS game, but could be used. Focus on the topics we have just covered when thinking about how to build out the game.

* **NOTE:** Donâ€™t use `document.write` as it will delete the contents of your page including your JavaScript. Use `document.querySelector` or `document.getElementById`, alongside either `innerHTML` or `textContent`, to write to the DOM.

* **NOTE:** Don't worry. We know this is a very challenging assignment. We also know that you won't know where to start. In fact, we haven't shown you EVERYTHING you need yet, but that's okay. Part of being a developer is figuring things out on your own through trial and error.

### Rock Paper Scissors Pseudocode

1. User chooses r, p, or s on keyboard representing rock, paper, or scissors.

<!-- var computerChoices = ["r", "p", "s"]; -->

2. Computer chooses a random value in a list of r, p, or s.

3. We determine if the user wins or not.

   * If user picks rock and if computer picks scissors then user wins.

   * If user picks rock and if computer picks paper then user loses.

   * If user picks scissors and if computer picks rock then user loses.

   * If user picks scissors and if computer picks paper then user wins.

   * If user picks paper and if computer picks rock then user wins.

   * If user picks paper and if computer picks scissors then user loses.

   * If user picks the same as computer then they tie.

4. We then add to their score.

   * If user wins then we add one to their wins.
    
   * If user loses then we add one to their losses.
    
   * If user ties then we add one to their ties.

5. The user then presses r, p, or s to play again.
